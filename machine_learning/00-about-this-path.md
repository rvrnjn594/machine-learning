Welcome to the **"Become a Machine Learning Engineer"** Path.  
This Path will help you learn data-manipulation and pre-processing using **pandas** and **Numpy**, and model creation and deployment using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**.  
It will also teach you to create end-to-end industry-standard solutions using these techniques.  
 If you are looking to start your career in the highly sought-after machine learning industry, then this is the right place for you, as this path will also help you prepare for job interviews.

## Prerequisites

In order to learn from this Path, you should be familiar with the following:

- Python programming
- Probablity basics

> If you're not familiar with any or all of these prerequisites, you can take a walk through the Pyhton for Programmers Path, which will help you learn them.
