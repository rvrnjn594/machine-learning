## A. Arithmetic

One of the main purpose of NumPy is to perform multi-dimensional arithmetic. Using NumPy arrays, we can apply arithmetic to each element with a single operation.

The code below shows multi-dimensional arithmetic with NumPy.

    arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    # Add 1 to element values
    print(repr(arr + 1))
    # Substract element values by 1.2
    print(repr(arr - 1.2))
    # Double element values
    print(repr(arr * 2))
    # Halve element values
    print(repr(arr / 2))
    # Integer division (half)
    print(repr(arr // 2))
    # Square element values
    print(repr(arr ** 2))
    # Square root element values
    print(repr(arr ** 0.5))

Using NumPy arithmetic, we can easily modify large amounts of numeric data with only a few operations.

> For example, we could convert a dataset of Fahrenheit temperatures to their equivalent Celsius form.

The code below converts Fahrenheit to Celsius in NumPy.

    def f2c(temps):
        return (5/9)*(temp-32)

    fahrenheits = np.array([32, -4, 14, -40])
    celsius = f2c(fahrenheits)
    print('Celsius: {}'.format(repr(celsius)))

It is important to note that performing arithmetic on NumPy arrays **does not change the original array,** and instead produces a new array that is the result of the arithmetic operation.

## B. Non-linear functions

Apart from basic arithmetic operations, NumPy also allows you to use non-linear functions such as exponentials and logarithms.

The function **np.exp** performs a base e exponential on an array, while the function **np.exp2** performs a base 2 exponential.  
 Likewise, **np.log, np.log2, and np.log10** all perform logarithms on an input array, using base e, base 2, and base 10, respectively.

The code below shows various exponentials and logarithms with NumPy.  
Note that np.e and np.pi represent the mathematical constants e and Ï€, respectively.

    arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    # Raised to power of e
    print(repr(np.exp(arr)))
    # Raised to power of 2
    print(repr(np.exp2(arr)))

    arr2 = np.array([[1, 10], [np.e, np.pi]])
    # Natural logarithm
    print(repr(np.log(arr2)))
    # Base 10 logarithm
    print(repr(np.log10(arr2)))

To do a regular power operation with any base, we use **np,power**.  
 The first argument to the function is the base, while the second is the power.  
 If the base or power is an array rather than a single number, the operation is applied to every element in the array.

The code below shows exmples of using np.power.

    arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    # Raise 3 to power of each number in arr
    print(repr(np.power(3, arr)))
    arr2 = np.array([[10.2, 4], [3, 5]])
    # Raise arr2 to power of each number in arr
    print(repr(np.power(arr2, arr)))

## C. Matrix Multiplication

Since NumPy arrays are basically vectors and matrices, it makes sense that there are functions for dot products and matrix multiplication.  
 Specifically, the main function to use is np.matmul, which takes two vector/matrix arrays as input and produces a dot product or matrix multiplication.

The code below shows various examples of matrix multiplication.  
 When both inputs are 1-D, the ouput is the dot product.

Note that the dimensions of the two input matrices must be valid for a matrix multiplication.  
 Specifically, the second dimension of the first matrix must equal the first dimension of the second matrix, **otherwise np.matmul will result in a ValueError.**

    arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    arr2 = np.array([-3, 0, 10])
    print(np.matmul(arr1, arr2))

    arr3 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
    arr4 = np.array([[-1, 0, 1], [3, 2, -4]])
    print(repr(np.matmul(arr3, arr4)))
    print(repr(np.matmul(arr4, arr3)))
    # This will result in a ValueError: If we uncomment line below
    # print(repr(np.matmul(arr3, arr3)))
